                Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Terms of Use, or any general legal principles to the
                contrary, any provision of these Terms of Use that imposes or contemplates continuing obligations on a

              <p class="text">
                The Company shall be excused from performance under these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase, to the
                extent it is prevented from or delayed from performing, in whole or in part, as a result of an event or
                series of events caused by or resulting from (1) weather conditions or other elements of nature or acts
                of God, (2) acts of war, acts of terrorism, insurrection, riots, civil disorders or rebellion, (3)
                quarantines or embargoes, (4) labor strikes, or (5) other causes beyond the reasonable control of the

              <p class="text">
                The items purchased through the Site are shipped by a third party carrier pursuant to a shipment
                contract. As a result, risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the
                carrier.

              <p class="text">
                If any of the provisions set forth in these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase are deemed invalid,
                void, or for any reason unenforceable, the parties agree that the court should endeavor to give effect
                to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the unenforceable condition shall be
                deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions of
                these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase. Section headings are for reference purposes only and do not
                limit the scope or extent of such section. These Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase and the
                relationship between you and the Company will be governed by the laws of the United States, to the
                extent not preempted by or inconsistent with federal law, without regard to its conflict of law
                provisions. For any actions not subject to arbitration, we each agree to submit to the personal
                jurisdiction of a court located in the United States.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                The failure of the Company to act with respect to a breach of these Terms of Use or the Terms of
                Purchase by you or others does not waive the Company’s right to act with respect to subsequent or
                similar breaches. If any content on this Site, or your use of the Site, is contrary to the laws of the
                place where you are when you access it, the Site is not intended for you, and we ask you not to use the
                Site. You are responsible for informing yourself of the laws of your jurisdiction and complying with

                The Company does not guarantee it will take action against all breaches of these Terms of Use or the

                Purchase, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase.

              <p class="text">
                You may not assign these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase (or any rights, benefits or obligations
                hereunder) by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the Company, which may
                be withheld at the Company’s sole discretion. Any attempted assignment that does not comply with these
                Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase shall be null and void. The Company may assign these Terms of Use
                or the Terms of Purchase, in whole or in part, to any third party in its sole discretion.

                In some instances, both of these Terms of Use and a separate document that provides additional

                there is a conflict between these Terms of Use and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will
                control unless the Additional Terms expressly state otherwise.
